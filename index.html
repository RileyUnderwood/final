      <p>Homicides dropped 6% in the United States from 2021 to 2022. However, not every state saw this dropoff. In fact, some saw the opposite happen. In a search to find the root of these disparities, we look through policing, gun controls, and drug trade in a search to find explanations.</p>

      <p>In one case, Washington D.C. saw a drastic negative change in the number of homicides between the compared years. The percent change went down over 28 points, while the number per 100,000 went down by over 11. That was the biggest number change, negative or positive, by 8. Much of this can be attributed to a crackdown on illegal guns in the District. D.C. police said they confiscated over 3,100 illegal firearms in 2022, 30 percent more than in 2021. In 2022, Democrat Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said that she was glad that policing and public health programs started to see results. The illegal gun problem has been a hot topic throughout the nation. On April 22, 2024, the Supreme Court agreed to listen to the appeal by the Biden administration in favor of regulations aimed at reining in and controlling ghost guns. Ghost guns are guns with parts that lack serial number, making them harder to track and keep records of. This is a move that hopes to control the amount of homicides that use these new waves of untrackable weapons.</p>

<div class="container"><p>This map is a state-by-state comparison of the homicide rate change from 2021 to 2022. The data used is per 100,000. For example, Kansas is -5.61%. That means that the homicides per 100,000 in 2022 are 5.61% lower than the homicides per 100,000 in 2021. The darker the blue gets, the more drastic the decrease was. The darker the red gets, the more drastic the increase was. The original homicide data was provided by the FBI. </p></div>

        <p>Louisiana houses the most dangerous city in the United States, New Orleans. Even though the Bayou State saw a -17.76% dropoff between 2021 and 2022, it still was listed as 2nd of the 51 (including District of Columbia) states in per capita totals. In ‘21 and ‘22, Louisiana was not a concealed carry state. But, on March 6th, 2024, Louisiana signed permitless carry into effect. The new law allows people 18 years and older to carry a concealed handgun in Louisiana without having to first ask the state government for permission. This move hopes to decrease the number of illegal guns, and hopefully, the homicides as well.</p>

        <p>The state that saw the biggest per capita increase is a state that's generally ranked as one of the safest in America. Vermont saw a whopping 144.41% increase in homicides per 100,000 residents. Between 2017 and 2021, about half of the homicides in Vermont involved a firearm. In 2022, the number rose to 86%. However, the sample size is much smaller. In 2021, Vermont saw seven firearm deaths. In 2022, that number rose to 21. State police stated that there was a sizable increase in drug-related crimes in 2022, especially with an influx of fentanyl into the state. Also, many of the ‘22 homicide victims were involved in the drug trade. Many state and local officials are moving to find ways to control the new phenomenon, however, little to no legislation has been passed.</p>

        <p>In New York, Onondaga County was 8th in total homicides in 2022, sitting right behind Suffolk and in front of Albany. In 2021, it was tied for 7th. However, along with the rest of the state, Onondaga’s homicides decreased significantly, from 33 murders to 21. Syracuse accounted for 18 of the 21 murders. In 2021, the city contributed 29 of the 31. Officer Burns of the Syracuse Police Department told me “there are a multitude of factors that affect gun violence. In Syracuse specifically, it’s often the severity of the weather. People aren’t shooting each other in a monsoon or blizzard. But also, the police presence throughout the year and the times the presence was felt more, there were less shootings.” He emphasized the main factor behind gun issues in the city is gang violence and drugs.</p>
   
        <p>Overall, gun violence throughout the United States declined between the two analyzed years. Many states’ main strategy to reduce the number in years to come seems to be by cracking down on different types of firearms.</p>
